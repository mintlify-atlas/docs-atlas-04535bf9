## Environment variables template

Copy this template and fill in your API keys. Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to git.

```bash .env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db

# AI APIs
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_...

# Search & Data
SERPER_API_KEY=...
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...

# Communications
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1...

# LiveKit
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://...

# Deployment
VERCEL_TOKEN=...
```

<Warning>
  Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file immediately after creating it to prevent accidentally committing secrets.
</Warning>

## Last-minute fixes

When things go wrong minutes before demo time, these fixes can save you.

<Accordion title="Deployment fails">
  Use Ngrok to expose your localhost when deployment doesn't work:
  
  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```
  
  Give judges the ngrok URL instead. It's not ideal, but it works.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CORS issues">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="FastAPI">
      ```python
      from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

      app.add_middleware(
          CORSMiddleware,
          allow_origins=["*"],
          allow_credentials=True,
          allow_methods=["*"],
          allow_headers=["*"],
      )
      ```
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Express">
      ```javascript
      const cors = require('cors');
      app.use(cors());
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database connection issues">
  Quick SQLite fallback when your database won't connect:
  
  ```python
  import sqlite3
  conn = sqlite3.connect('hackathon.db')
  ```
  
  Not production-ready, but gets you through the demo.
</Accordion>

## Judging day checklist

Use this checklist on presentation day to make sure you're ready.

- [ ] Record backup demo video (use Loom)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Prepare 3-minute pitch
- [ ] Have localhost running (+ Ngrok ready as backup)
- [ ] Print architecture diagram
- [ ] List all APIs used (show free tiers)
- [ ] Prepare GitHub repo link
- [ ] Battery charged, charger ready

## Pitch structure (3 minutes)

Follow this proven structure for maximum impact with judges.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hook + Problem (0:00-0:30)">
    Start with a shocking statistic OR personal story. Explain why current solutions fail.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Live Demo (0:30-2:00)">
    Spend 60% of your time showing the core feature working. Handle edge cases gracefully.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tech Stack + Innovation (2:00-2:30)">
    Highlight free/open-source tools you used. Mention any novel approaches you took.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Business Model + Q&A (2:30-3:00)">
    Explain how it scales and revenue potential. Take questions from judges.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Judges remember demos, not slides. Spend most of your time showing your working product.
</Tip>

## Debug commands

Common commands for fixing issues fast.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Port conflicts
# Check what's using a port
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

```bash Node.js issues
# Reset node_modules
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

```bash Python cache
# Clear Python cache
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -r {} +
```

```bash Git reset
# Reset everything (CAREFUL!)
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
```

```bash Docker cleanup
# Free up disk space
docker system prune -a
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  The `git reset --hard` command permanently deletes uncommitted changes. Make sure you want to lose that work before running it.
</Warning>

## Resource limits

Know these limits and backup plans before you hit them during your demo.

| Service | Rate Limit | Action if Hit |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| OpenAI Free | 3 RPM | Use Hugging Face |
| Serper | Depends on tier | Cache results |
| Vercel | 100 GB bandwidth | Use Netlify |
| Render Free | Sleeps after 15m | Keep-alive ping |

<Note>
  Cache API responses during development to avoid hitting rate limits. Most services count requests, not cached responses.
</Note>

## Emergency contacts

Save these in your phone before the hackathon starts:

- Teammate 1: [Phone]
- Teammate 2: [Phone]
- Faculty Mentor: [Phone]
- Venue WiFi Password: [Password]

<Tip>
  Take a screenshot of the WiFi password and save it to your device. You'll thank yourself when the venue loses the paper with credentials.
</Tip>
