## Best practices for hackathons

<Warning>
  **Don't reinvent the wheel** - Judges care about functionality and innovation, not whether you wrote every animation from scratch. Use these libraries to ship faster.
</Warning>

### Quick tips

1. **Start with a template** - Pick a component and customize it rather than building from scratch
2. **Test on mobile** - Both libraries are responsive, but always verify on actual devices
3. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-animate. One or two standout effects > ten competing animations
4. **Performance matters** - Test load times. Remove unused components before deploying
5. **Accessibility first** - Ensure animations don't cause motion sickness (provide reduced motion options)

### Component selection strategy

<Accordion title="For landing pages">
  Use Aceternity UI's hero sections and gradient backgrounds. Add React Bits text animations for headings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For dashboards">
  Use Aceternity UI cards and navigation. Keep animations subtle for better usability.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For portfolios">
  Combine both! React Bits for creative effects, Aceternity UI for consistent layout components.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For demos">
  Focus on Aceternity UI modals and expandable cards to showcase features interactively.
</Accordion>

## Example integration

Here's how you might combine both libraries in a hackathon project:

```jsx
import { AnimatedCard } from './components/aceternity/AnimatedCard';
import { TypewriterEffect } from './components/reactbits/TypewriterEffect';
import { ParticleBackground } from './components/reactbits/ParticleBackground';

function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className="relative min-h-screen">
      {/* React Bits particle background */}
      <ParticleBackground />
      
      <div className="relative z-10 container mx-auto px-4 py-20">
        {/* React Bits text animation */}
        <TypewriterEffect 
          words={["Build", "Ship", "Win"]}
          className="text-6xl font-bold"
        />
        
        {/* Aceternity UI cards */}
        <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-12">
          <AnimatedCard title="Feature 1">
            Lightning-fast deployment
          </AnimatedCard>
          <AnimatedCard title="Feature 2">
            AI-powered insights
          </AnimatedCard>
          <AnimatedCard title="Feature 3">
            Real-time collaboration
          </AnimatedCard>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
