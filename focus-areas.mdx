We especially welcome contributions in these key areas that can make a significant impact on hackathon success.

## Priority contribution areas

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="India-specific tools and APIs" icon="flag" color="#ea580c">
    Platforms and services tailored for the Indian market, including payment gateways like Razorpay, regional APIs, and India-focused developer tools that are essential for hackathons targeting Indian users.
    
    **Why it matters**: Many hackathons in India require region-specific integrations for payments, verification, and local services.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Emerging AI agent frameworks" icon="robot" color="#8b5cf6">
    New and innovative AI agent frameworks, orchestration tools, and agentic AI platforms that enable multi-step reasoning, autonomous task completion, and intelligent automation.
    
    **Why it matters**: AI agents are rapidly evolving and hackathon participants need up-to-date options for building intelligent applications.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Real-time communication platforms" icon="tower-broadcast" color="#0ea5e9">
    WebRTC technologies, real-time messaging, video/audio streaming platforms, and low-latency communication tools that enable live collaboration and interaction.
    
    **Why it matters**: Real-time features are increasingly popular in hackathon projects, from collaborative tools to live gaming and social apps.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data processing and ETL tools" icon="database" color="#06b6d4">
    Tools for extracting, transforming, and loading data, including stream processing, data pipelines, batch processing frameworks, and data orchestration platforms.
    
    **Why it matters**: Data-intensive projects need efficient ways to process and transform data, especially when working with large datasets or real-time streams.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Authentication and security services" icon="shield-check" color="#10b981">
    Modern authentication platforms, identity providers, security libraries, OAuth/SSO services, and tools for managing user access and protecting applications.
    
    **Why it matters**: Security is often overlooked in hackathons, but having easy-to-implement auth solutions helps teams build secure MVPs quickly.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Creative coding and visualization libraries" icon="palette" color="#ec4899">
    Libraries and tools for generative art, data visualization, interactive graphics, animation frameworks, and creative expression through code.
    
    **Why it matters**: Visual impact can make hackathon demos more compelling, and creative coding tools enable unique, memorable presentations.

  - **Code examples**: Show practical implementation snippets
  - **Free tier details**: Clearly state what's available without payment
  - **Quick start info**: Link to fastest way to get started
  - **Comparison context**: Mention when to use this over alternatives
</Note>

## Emerging trends to watch

While we focus on the areas above, we're also interested in contributions related to:

- **Edge computing**: Platforms that enable computation at the edge for low-latency applications
- **Blockchain and Web3**: Developer-friendly blockchain APIs and decentralized platforms
- **IoT and hardware**: APIs and platforms for connecting hardware to software projects
- **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, and debugging tools suitable for hackathon MVPs
- **Developer experience**: Tools that significantly speed up development and deployment

<Tip>
  Don't see your area of expertise listed? We still want your contributions! These focus areas represent current priorities, but we welcome high-quality additions across all categories.
</Tip>

## Regional expansion

Beyond India-specific tools, we're interested in resources for other regions:

- Southeast Asia-specific platforms and APIs
- European market tools (GDPR-compliant services, EU payment processors)
- Latin American developer platforms
- African fintech and mobile-first services

<Warning>
  When adding regional tools, ensure you clearly indicate the region/country in your description and explain any limitations or requirements.
